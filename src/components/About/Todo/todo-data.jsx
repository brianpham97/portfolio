      `I'm a big fan of Korean culture, especially on their clean fashion and their emphasis on beauty. I became really big on fashion when I noticed I have a "look good feel good personaltiy". Because of that, I always wanted to find out what I think I look best in. When I came across Korea fashion through vloggers on youtube, I started trying their hairstyle tutorials and adapt their fits to my liking. I also love the skincare culture Korea has of always trying to look young so I try to discipline myself to do my routine everyday as well.`,
      `A joke I always make is to go to Korea with an empty suitcase and return with it full of clothes and products from there. This is one of my dream solo trips I want to do for myself to experience the culture for myself firsthand.`,

      `Unlike Korea, I want to explore Japan more for the views. Things that Japan is known for like their Sakura Blossons, their shrines, parks, temples, and the city life of Tokyo.`,
      `In terms of their culture, I'm mainly interested in seeing the communities focused on anime because it's where it originates. Looking forward to seeing what events they host catered to this attractive as well as any appearal you would not be able to find in the United States.`,
