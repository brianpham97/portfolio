      "I kinda lived under a rock when it came to music until college so I didn't develop any taste for music for a while. I went to my first music festival in 2016 and to be honest, it was really boring at the time. I started going more just for friends but over time I started to develop my preference for music. The one song that got me into edm was Hero by Cash Cash and I began to have an appreciation for lyrics. When I see line ups now, I always see if there are artists that play music that has fun karaoke vibes. Even at the music festivals, my favorite thing to do just to scream the lyrics with people because that's the way I have the most fun expressing myself at these events.",

      "As I mentioned earlier, I only started getting into R&B pretty late as well. Most R&B I remember was from the radio when I as young but the desire to look for new R&B music to add to a playlist came pretty recently. Similar to my taste for edm music, I love lyrics and for R&B's case, I gravitate to the songs I find a strong feeling for in the lyrics and for the karaoke vibes.",
