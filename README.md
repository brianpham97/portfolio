# Brian Pham Portfolio

Here is a personal portfolio with a responsive design I made for fun to document my projects over the course of my software engineering experience as well as to talk about some current interests and future plans I want to do ~

Vite was used to start up the project and design was mostly done using TailwindCSS.
